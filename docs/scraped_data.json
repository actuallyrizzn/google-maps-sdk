These layers are available in select regions.\n\nTraffic Layer\n\nThe Maps JavaScript API allows you to add real-time traffic information (where supported) to your maps using the TrafficLayer object. Traffic information is refreshed frequently, but not instantly. Rapid consecutive requests for the same area are unlikely to yield different results.\n\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nfunction initMap(): void {\n  const map = new google.maps.Map(\n    document.getElementById(\"map\") as HTMLElement,\n    {\n      zoom: 13,\n      center: { lat: 34.04924594193164, lng: -118.24104309082031 },\n    }\n  );\n\n  const trafficLayer = new google.maps.TrafficLayer();\n\n  trafficLayer.setMap(map);\n}\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface Window {\n    initMap: () => void;\n  }\n}\nwindow.initMap = initMap;\nindex.ts\nNote: Read the guide on using TypeScript and Google Maps.\nView example\nTry Sample\nJSFiddle.net\nGoogle Cloud Shell\nTransit Layer\n\nThe Maps JavaScript API allows you to display the public transit network of a city on your map using the TransitLayer object. When the Transit Layer is enabled, and the map is centered on a city that supports transit information, the map will display major transit lines as thick, colored lines. The color of the line is set based upon information from the transit line operator. Enabling the Transit Layer will alter the style of the base map to better emphasize transit routes.\n\nIf you’re a public agency that oversees public transportation for your city and would like your data to be included, please visit the Google Transit Partner Program site to learn more.\n\nThe following example shows the Transit layer enabled on a map of London, UK:\n\nTypeScript\nJavaScript\nfunction initMap(): void {\n  const map = new google.maps.Map(\n    document.getElementById(\"map\") as HTMLElement,\n    {\n      zoom: 13,\n      center: { lat: 51.501904, lng: -0.115871 },\n    }\n  );\n\n  const transitLayer = new google.maps.TransitLayer();\n\n  transitLayer.setMap(map);\n}\n\ndeclare global {\n  interface Window {\n    initMap: () => void;\n  }\n}\nwindow.initMap = initMap;\nindex.ts\nNote: Read the guide on using TypeScript and Google Maps.\nView example\nTry Sample\nJSFiddle.net\nGoogle Cloud Shell\nBicycling Layer\n\nThe Maps JavaScript API allows you to add bicycle in"

It uses these points to find nearby road segments and returns a Place ID along with metadata such as the nearest road segment and speed limits.\nWhy use the Roads API\n\nWith the Roads API, you can get speed limits, estimated arrival times, or other road metadata. With this road metadata, you can enhance your driving apps with the follow capabilities:\n\nConnect latitude/longitude coordinates with a road or roads.\nFind the nearest road for a set of coordinates\nGet speed limits for road segments\nWhat you can do with the Roads API\n\nWith the Roads API, you can map GPS coordinates to the geometry of the road, and determine the speed limit along road segments.\n\nSnap to Roads This service returns the most likely roads traveled based on the provided set of GPS coordinates. You can specify up to 100 GPS points collected along a route. Optionally, you can also request that the service interpolates additional points, resulting in a path that smoothly follows the geometry of the road.\nNearest Roads This service returns the nearest road segment for a GPS point. You can specify up to 100 GPS points. The points you specify don't need to be part of a continuous path.\nSpeed limits This service returns the posted speed limit for a road segment. The Speed Limit service is available to all customers with an Asset Tracking license. For Google Maps Platform Premium Plan customers who transitioned to pay-as-you-go pricing, the feature remains active.\nHow the Roads API works\n\nThe Roads API uses three endpoints which accept latitude/longitude coordinates or place IDs to provide road paths, segments, or speed limit data. The following example shows a request for nearest roads based on a set of latitude/longitude coordinates:\n\nhttps://roads.googleapis.com/v1/nearestRoads\n  ?points=60.170880%2C24.942795%7C60.170879%2C24.942796%7C60.170877%2C24.942796\n  &key=YOUR_API_KEY\nResources\n\nThe following table summarizes the resources available through the Roads API along with the data it returns.\n\nData resources\tData returned\tReturn format\nSnap to roads\t\n\nReturns an array of up to 100 GPS points from a route. Includes road-snapped longitude/latitude coordinates along with place IDs. See details in Responses in the Snap to roads guide.\n\n\t\nJSON\n\nNearest roads\t\n\nAn array of up to 100 independent latitude/longitude coordinates along with place IDs for the nearest road for each specified point. Points do not need to be continuous. See details in Responses in the Nearest roads guide.\n\n\nSpeed limits\t\n\nAn array of up to 100 road metadata elements. These contain speed limits and place IDs, with units either in KPH or MPH. See details in Responses in the Speed limits guide.\n\nHow to use the Roads API\n1\tTry the snap to roads demo\tClick the demo to create a track and see how the snap to roads endpoint provides smooth data. See Demo in the Snap to roads guide. You don't need an API key.\n2\tGet set up\tStart with Set up your Google Cloud project and complete the setup instructions that follow and then learn how to use your API key.\n3\tTry a snap to roads request\tUse one of the snap to roads examples and try one relevant to your use case.\n4\tGet speed limits for your road path\tUsing the same path data you provided for your snap to roads request, issue a speed limit query. See the Example request using a path.\n5\tLearn how to process long paths\tFollow the sections on Processing long paths in the Advanced concepts guide.\n6\tIncorporate road data into your own app!\tSee the detailed code example from the road snapped demo to start building road data functionality into your own app.\nAvailable client libraries\n\nCall this API in the language of your choice through one of the following client libraries:\n\nJava Client for Google Maps Services\nPython Client for Google Maps Services\nGo Client for Google Maps Services\nNode.js Client for Google Maps Services\n\nThe Java Client, Python Client, Go Client and Node.js Client for Google Maps Services are community-supported client libraries, open sourced under the Apache 2.0 License. Download them from GitHub, where you can also find installation instructions and sample code.\n\nWhat's next\nTry out the Roads API: Go to Roads Inspector\nLearn how to make Roads API requests: Go to the service you're interested in:\nSnap to roads\nNearest roads\nSpeed limits\nUnderstand Advanced Concepts: Go to Advanced Con"

For more information about Legacy status and how to migrate from Legacy to newer services, see Legacy products and features.\nHome\nProducts\nGoogle Maps Platform\nDocumentation\nWeb Services\nDirections API (Legacy)\nWas this helpful?\nSend feedback\nGetting directions through the Directions API\nbookmark_border\nEuropean Economic Area (EEA) developers\n\nFor direction calculations that respond in real time to user input (for example, within a user interface element), you can use the Directions API or, if you're using the Maps JavaScript API, use the Directions service. For server-side use, you can use Java Client, Python Client, Go Client and Node.js Client for Google Maps Services.\n\nWith the Directions API (Legacy), you can:\n\nSearch for directions for several modes of transportation, including transit, driving, walking or cycling.\nReturn multi-part directions using a series of waypoints.\nSpecify origins, destinations, and waypoints as text strings (that is, \"Chicago, IL\" or \"Darwin, NT, Australia\"), as place IDs, or as latitude/longitude coordinates.\n\nThe API returns the most efficient routes when calculating directions. Travel time is the primary factor optimized, but the API may also take into account other factors such as distance, number of turns and many more when deciding which route is the most efficient.\n\nBefore you begin\n\nBefore you start using the Directions API, you need a project with a billing account and the Directions API enabled. To learn more, see Set up in Cloud console.\n\nBuilding your Directions API requests\n\nA Directions API (Legacy) request takes the following form:\n\nhttps://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/directions/outputFormat?parameters\n\n\nwhere outputFormat may be either of the following values:\n\njson (recommended) indicates output in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\nxml indicates output as XML\n\nNote: URLs must be properly encoded to be valid and are limited to 16384 characters for all web services. Be aware of this limit when constructing your URLs.\n\nAs is standard in URLs, all parameters are separated using the ampersand (&) character. All reserved characters (for example the plus sign \"+\") must be URL-encoded. The list of parameters and their possible values are enumerated below.\n\nRequired parameters\ndestination\n\nThe place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value to which you wish to calculate directions. The options for the destination parameter are the same as for the origin parameter.\n\norigin\n\nThe place ID, address, or textual latitude/longitude value from which you wish to calculate directions.\n\nPlace IDs must be prefixed with place_id:. You can retrieve place IDs from the Geocoding API and the Places API (including Place Autocomplete). For an example using place IDs from Place Autocomplete, see Place Autocomplete and Directions. For more about place IDs, see the Place ID overview.\n\norigin=place_id:ChIJ3S-JXmauEmsRUcIaWtf4MzE\n\n\nIf you pass an address, the Directions service geocodes the string and converts it to a latitude/longitude coordinate to calculate directions. This coordinate may be different from that returned by the Geocoding API, for example a building entrance rather than its center.\n\norigin=24+Sussex+Drive+Ottawa+ON\n\n\nUsing place IDs is preferred over using addresses or latitude/longitude coordinates. Using coordinates will always result in the point being snapped to the road nearest to those coordinates - which may not be an access point to the property, or even a road that will quickly or safely lead to the destination.\n\nIf you pass coordinates, the point will snap to the nearest road. Passing a place ID is preferred. If you do pass coordinates, ensure that no space exists between the latitude and longitude values.\n\norigin=41.43206,-81.38992\n\n\nPlus codes must be formatted as a global code or a compound code. Format plus codes as shown here (plus signs are url-escaped to %2B and spaces are url-escaped to %20).\n\nGlobal code is a 4 character area code and 6 character or longer local code (849VCWC8+R9 is 849VCWC8%2BR9).\nCompound code is a 6 character or longer local code with an explicit location (CWC8+R9 Mountain View, CA, USA is CWC8%2BR9%20Mountain%20View%20CA%20USA).\nNote: For efficiency and accuracy, use place ID's when possible. These ID's are uniquely explicit like a lat/lng value pair and provide geocoding benefits for routing such as access points and traffic variables. Unlike an address, ID's do not require the service to perform a search or an intermediate request for place details; therefore, performance is better.\nOptional parameters\nalternatives\n\nIf set to true, specifies that the Directions service may prov"
